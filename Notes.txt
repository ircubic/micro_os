Higher-Half
===

At bootup, the kernel is loaded into physical address 0x00100000, but virtual
address 0xC0100000.  Thus it uses a trick when starting up that utilizes a
"fake" GDT that makes this work until paging is set up. Any code BEFORE paging
is set up needs to refer to physical memory with the proper offset.

Memory map
===

The kernel lays itself out using this memory map:

Kernel code resides from 0xC0100000 up to the nearest MB after its end.
Page allocation bitmap and page directory also lies here.
